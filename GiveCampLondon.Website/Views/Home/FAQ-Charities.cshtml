<h2>
    WHEN IS THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING MY CHARITY’S PROPOSAL?</h2>
<p>
    The deadline for submissions is Friday 23rd September 2011.</p>
<br />
<h2>
    DO I NEED TO BE PRESENT AT CIVECAMP?</h2>
<p>
    In our experience, projects are rarely successful if the charity stakeholder(s)
    cannot be present. To get the best out of this experience we strongly recommend
    that a person who understand the needs of your project and has been involved in
    the submission process is available throughout the process. Although you don't need
    to camp out with the volunteers we request that you are present for both the kick
    off ceremony on the Friday and the demonstrations on the Sunday. It is also recommended
    that you are available for your project team either in person or on the telephone
    during working hours of Saturday 22nd October.</p>
<br />
<h2>
    HOW DO I SUBMIT MY PROPOSAL?</h2>
<p>
    Please use the submission outline to send us details of your project.</p>
<p>
    Please be as thorough as you can, because the more information that we get from
    you about what you are trying to achieve, the better our chances of successfully
    scoping your project for our GiveCamp volunteers to complete.</p>
<br />
<h2>
    WHEN WILL I FIND OUT IF MY PROPOSAL HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR GIVECAMP UK?</h2>
<p>
    We hope to contact all of our successful project stakeholders 3 weeks before the
    start of GiveCamp.</p>
<br />
<h2>
    WHAT KIND OF PROJECT CAN I SUBMIT TO GIVECAMP UK FOR CONSIDERATION?</h2>
<p>
    Our technical volunteers have a wide-ranging skill set and will be familiar with
    building a huge variety of applications.</p>
<p>
    Some suggestions for projects might be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Establishing a web presence through a simple website</li>
    <li>Updating your charity’s existing website</li>
    <li>Developing a calendar application to show your charity’s upcoming events</li>
    <li>Creating a database to allow you to keep in contact with your donors</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you are unsure as to whether your project is suitable for GiveCamp UK, please
    submit it via the submission form and we will see if it is viable to be completed
    in whole or in part over the course of the GiveCamp UK weekend.</p>
<br />
<h2>
    WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER MY PROJECT PROPOSAL HAS BEEN ACCEPTED?</h2>
<p>
    Once you have received news that your project has been selected, one of our technical
    architects will contact you to talk in more detail about the proposal. We will want
    to find out if there are technical solutions that we need to put into place before
    GiveCamp UK kicks off such as setting up website hosting or collecting user login
    information, logos, non-copyrighted website images, or other items that your team
    will need for the weekend.</p>
