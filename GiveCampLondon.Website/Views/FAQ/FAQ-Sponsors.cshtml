    Information for Sponsors</h1>
    <br />
<p>
    GiveCamp events would be entirely impossible without the support and generosity
    of sponsors.</p>
<p>
    Teams of hard-working professionals working almost 48 hours straight over one weekend
    need sustenance and support to help them complete their chosen charity project.</p>
<br />
<h2>
    WHAT DOES GIVECAMP UK NEED FROM SPONSORS?</h2>
<p>
    We're looking for generous sponsors to donate swag, software licenses, hosting space,
    stationery supplies and financial support to our event.</p>
<p>
    In addition to financial assistance, perhaps consider donating the following items for our "swag bags":</p>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>- T-Shirts</li>
    <li>- Laptop Stickers</li>
    <li>- Goodie-bag items for Developers</li>
    <li>- Goodie-bag items for Charities</li>
    <li>- Meals, Snacks and Drinks</li>
    <li>- ID Badges and Printer Ink</li>
    <li>- Pens, Notepads, Flip Chart Pads, Marker Pens</li>
</ul>
<br />
