While you can get direct usage of the CE provider to work without installing 
these, for the connectiong string provider to work it has to be installed.
This may not be necessary if you can figure out a way to get the connection
string provider to work without installing it but you would still have to figure
out a way to get x86 and x64 different references to work. I think the easiest
way is to just install the 2.5MB install.
